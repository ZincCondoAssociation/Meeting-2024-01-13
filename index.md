# Annual Condo Association Meeting Notes
### 1/13/2024 4:30 pm

### In attendance: Ben Faricy, Patrick Duke, Natalie Elaine, Alexandria Miller, Bruce Eckel

## Topics

- Drip from top balcony
- Closet needs to only contain condo association items
- Get on mike's list for the roof snow removal
- Front snow removal; Mimi has had to shovel twice. They just seem to be
  doing the berm, but there's been shoveling in the back, but we are having
  to shovel the back deck sometimes.
  - Proposal for anyone in the association who does the snow removal when the
    snow removal people don't come can bill the association for their time.
  - Alex will print a Log sheet for when we have to shovel and put it on the back
    of the closet door. We'll do that for a couple of months and then revisit.
- Back deck turns into an ice sheet if it doesn't get shoveled when the snow
  is fresh, then becomes dangerous and hard to remove.
  - We will buy a heated mat for the back deck, Alex will check.
- Fire extinguishers: two condo ones need inspection. Each unit needs one as
  well but those don't get inspection.
- Ben changed the inside bulbs.
- Front door exterior needs repainting. Exterior painting is due. Sean Crossan
  was suggested. Ask Amanda about painting whether we need an assessment.
- 3% to 5% dues raise is suggested. 
  Consider the possibility of unexpected issues and the need for reserves.
  Decided to leave it the same and do assessments if necessary.
- Alex's father in law is a commercial roofer and can take a look at the
  roof this summer.
- Hoping to paint the building either in June or September. Keep the same colors.
- Radon plastic goes on the ground to block the radon, consider getting it.
- Consider either a replacement back door or a storm door. We seem to prefer
  a new back door. Ask David Russel.
- Vacuuming: Alex will make a log sheet. When vacuuming does happen it needs
  to happen when it's timely from a noise standpoint. 
- Carpet Cleaning: Joe Webber, company "The Finest Detail." End of May.
- Dish antennas can be removed.
- Bikes should not be brought into the building. Bruce has added this to the Evolve web site.
- Sign or talk to UPS to put packages along the side hall.
- If music or noise gets too loud, talk to whoever is doing it.
